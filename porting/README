CPROTO/PORTING

The files in this directory are needed on MSDOS or VMS to build CPROTO.
They all assume that you've already got lex and yacc or flex and bison.

	getopt.c, getopt.h - public domain getopt function for systems
		that don't already have it (i.e., MSDOS, VMS).
 
 	popen.c - fakes a pipe open/close by writing to a temporary file.
 
	turboc.mak - makefile for Turbo C/C++ 3.0 for MS-DOS.

	borland.mak - makefile for Borland C for MS-DOS

	borland.os2 - makefile for Borland C+ for OS/2

	micrsoft.mak - makefile for Microsoft C.

	descrip.mms - makefile for VAX C.
