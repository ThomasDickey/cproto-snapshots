CPROTO/PORTING

The files in this directory are needed on MSDOS or VMS to build CPROTO.
They all assume that you've already got lex and yacc or flex and bison.

	getopt.c, getopt.h - a free version of getopt function for systems that
		don't already have it (i.e., MSDOS, VMS).  Some systems that
		support auto-configuration may need these files; you'll have to
		edit the makefile in that case.

	popen.c - fakes a pipe open/close by writing to a temporary file.

	turboc.mak - makefile for Turbo C/C++ 3.0 for MS-DOS.

	borland.mak - makefile for Borland C

	micrsoft.mak - makefile for Microsoft C.

	descrip.mms - makefile for VAX C.
