Version 3

Patchlevel 10 (dickey, September 1994)

- corrected two malloc-defects in lint library generation (one place where
  generated parameter name was copied rather than allocated, and another
  memory leak).

- corrected generation of lint library function body, to handle function
  pointers.

- changed the implicit lint library function type from "" to "void", to
  avoid special-cases in the function-body generation.

Patchlevel 9 (dickey, August 1994)

- use 'autoconf' to make a UNIX configure-script.

- recognize GCC extensions '__inline' and '__attribute__'

- added ifdef OPT_LINTLIBRARY to allow compiling without the lint library
  code (saves about 4kb).

- corrected some logic that made incorrect commenting for options -c -f1
  (e.g., "void (*Sigdisp(int sig, void (*func)(int sig)))(int sig)").

- corrected logic that macroizes (e.g., with P_) functions like 'Sigdisp'
  (it wasn't doing anything about the trailing "(int sig)").

- corrected handling of K&R conversion of mixed-mode functions (K&R style
  with prototypes in arguments) to avoid losing comments.

- modified logic for options -c -f2 so that cproto inserts a space before
  the beginning of a comment when it immediately follows an '*'.

- enhanced error reporting with new module yyerror.c which (attempts to)
  report the expected token type/name when a syntax error is encountered.

- modified the grammar.y file to try to recover from errors at the next
  semicolon (as well as the next right curly bracket).

- modified to process lex/yacc files with gcc as C-preprocessor.

- Added option "-O" to force redirection of errors without shell operations
  (useful for VAX/VMS and MS-DOS in particular).

- added "\s" as a synonym for space in the format options (-P, -F, -C)

- tested on Solaris with lex/yacc and flex 2.4.6 / bison 1.22
  (SunOS explorer 5.3 Generic_101318-42 sun4m sparc; gcc 2.6.0)

- tested on SunOS 4.1.1 with lex/yacc and flex 2.4.6 / bison 1.22
  (SunOS calvin 4.1.1 1 sun4c)

- tested on IRIX with lex/yacc
  (IRIX dbs3 5.2 02282015 IP19 mips)

- tested on Linux 0.99.15 with lex/yacc and flex 2.4.6 / bison 1.22 / byacc 1.9

- tested on MS-DOS with flex 2.37 / byacc 1.9 (built with turboc.mak).
  (Bison uses too much stack space).

- tested on VAX/VMS 6.1 with VAX-C 3.2 and flex 2.4.6 / bison 1.22.

- moved non-UNIX files into 'porting' subdirectory.

- added 'testing' subdirectory, for simple regression tests.

- tested for memory leaks with dbmalloc (on Linux).

Patchlevel 8 (internal: dickey/cthuang, June 1993)

- added files 'lintlibs.c' and 'strkey.c'

- Allow dollar signs in identifiers

- Defined FAIL, SUCCESS to use in 'exit()' calls (VMS is approximately the
  reverse of UNIX).

- Added option "-o" to force redirection without shell operations (useful for
  VAX/VMS in particular).

- Added options "-l" (lintlibrary format), "-T" (typedefs), "-x" (externs
  in include-files).

- Added "-C" option to cpp-invocation (to support VARARGS-decoding for -l
  option).

- Modified grammar.y so that if -T option is turned on, instances of untagged
  struct, union or enum are shown with the contents of the curly braces.

- Modified lex.l so that it sets 'return_val' iff at least one return statement
  within curly braces returns an expression.  Use this to support -l option.

- Modified semantic.c (for -l option) to put tabs after short names for better
  readability.  Also (only -l option), put a blank line before function
  definitions and typedefs.

- Corrected lex.l so that it recognizes preprocessor lines within curly braces.

- Modified 'gen_prototype()' to trim 'extern' and 'auto' keywords from the text
  (so that 'extern' is emitted in this function only if the -e option is
  specified).  Do this to support -l option (and to correct normal usage, which
  implies that -e option is needed to put an 'extern' before declaration).

- Corrected test in 'put_decl_spec()' by using 'strkey()' (which tests for a
  name, not simply a substring).

- Modified semantic.c to use 'put_string()' and related procedures to simplify
  pretty-printing of lint-library text (mainly to control blank lines).  (See
  'fmt_library()').

- linted some xmalloc calls using ALLOC macro.

Patchlevel 7

- Fix: The processing of string literals is now more robust.

- Removed the -f4 option which generated prototypes like

	int main P_((int argc, char **argv));

  Use the -m option now to put a guard macro around the prototype
  parameter list.  Use the -m option together with -f3 (which is the
  default) to produce the same output as the old -f4 option.  The option
  to set the guard macro name is now -M.

- Comments in prototype parameter lists are now disabled by default.
  Use the -c option now to output these comments.

- Can now process #include directives in which the file is specified with
  a #define macro.

- Now does not convert function definitions that take the formal
  parameter va_alist from <varargs.h>.

- Now recognizes the GNU C modifiers __const and __inline__.

Patchlevel 6

- Fix: A function in lex.l exploited the ANSI C feature of concatenating
  string literals.  This prevented the module from being compiled with
  pre-ANSI C compilers.

Patchlevel 5

- Fix: The -v option did not output declarations for function pointers.

- Fix: String literals continued over more than one line messed up the
  line number count.

- Fix: The program generated incorrect prototypes for functions that
  take a variable argument list using <varargs.h>.

- Fix: When converting functions from the standard input, cproto
  generated no output if no functions needed to be converted.

- Fix: Now does not output a warning if an untagged struct is found in a
  typedef declaration.

- Added the -b option which rewrites function definition heads to
  include both old style and new style declarations separated by a
  conditional compilation directive.  For example, the program can
  generate

	#ifdef ANSI_FUNC

	int
	main (int argc, char *argv[])
	#else

	int
	main (argc, argv)
	int argc;
	char *argv[]
	#endif
	{
	}

  Added the -B option to set the preprocessor directive that appears at
  the beginning of such definitions.

- Added the keyword "interrupt" to the set of type qualifiers when
  compiled on a UNIX system.

- The MS-DOS version now recognizes the type modifiers introduced by
  Microsoft C/C++ 7.00.

- Now recognizes ANSI C trigraphs (yuck!).

- Now use "#if __STDC__" instead of "#if defined(__STDC__)".

- GNU bison orders the y.tab.c sections differently than yacc, which
  resulted in references to variables before they were declared.  The
  grammar specification was modified to also be compatible with bison.

Patchlevel 4

- Fix: A typedef name defined as a pointer to char, short or float was
  incorrectly promoted if it was used to specify a formal parameter.
  For example, for the definition

	typedef char *caddr_t;

	int strlen (s)
	caddr_t s;
	{
	}

  cproto generated the incorrect prototype

	int strlen(int s);

- Added implementation of the ANSI function tmpfile() for systems that
  don't have it.
- If compiled with Microsoft C, cproto preprocesses its input by running
  the command "cl /E".  To eliminate the error messages when the file
  <malloc.h> is included, the program now recognizes the specifier
  _based(void).

Patchlevel 3

- Fix: The program didn't generate prototypes for functions defined with
  the extern specifier.
- Fix: The -c option didn't output a space before parameter names in
  generated prototypes.
- Added the -E option to specify a particular C preprocessor to run or
  to stop the program from running the C preprocessor.
- Added the -q option to stop the program from outputting error messages
  when it cannot read the file specified in an #include directive.
- Made the yacc specification compatible with UNIX SYSVR4 yacc.
  
Patchlevel 2

- Fix: The function definition conversion may produce a mangled function
  definition if an #include directive appears before the function and
  no comments appear between the directive and the function.
- Fix: The size of the buffer allocated for the C preprocessor command
  string did not include enough space for options set in the environment
  variable CPROTO.
- Replaced the -n option with -c which disables all comments in the
  generated prototypes.
- Replaced the enum's with #define constants to accommodate C compilers
  that don't like enumerators in constant expressions.

Patchlevel 1

- Fix: The program was calling ftell() on an invalid FILE pointer.

Patchlevel 0

- Added options to convert function definitions between the old style
  and ANSI C style.
- Options can be specified from the environment variable CPROTO.
- The MS-DOS version recognizes more Microsoft C and Borland C++ type
  modifiers (such as _cdecl, _far, _near).
- Fix: Formal parameters specified with typedef names were not promoted.
  For example, for the definition

	typedef unsigned short ushort;

	void test (x)
	ushort x;
	{
	}

  cproto generated the incorrect prototype

	void test(ushort x);

  while the correct one is

	void test(int x);

- Fix: Incorrect prototypes were generated for functions that returned
  function pointers.  For example, cproto generated an incorrect
  prototype for the function definition

	void (*signal(int x, void (*func)(int y)))(int z)
	{
	}

- Fix: Changed calls to memory allocation functions to abort the program
  if they fail.

Version 2

Patchlevel 3

- Made cproto compatible with GNU flex.
- After compiling with the preprocessor symbol TURBO_CPP defined, on
  MS-DOS systems, cproto will pipe its input through the Turbo C
  preprocessor.
- Fix: Typedef names may now be omitted from typedef declarations.
  For example, every C compiler I tried accepts

	typedef int;

  and some even give warnings when encountering this statement.

Patchlevel 2

- Cproto is now able to generate prototypes for functions defined in lex
  and yacc source files named on the command line.  Lex and yacc source
  files are recognized by the .l or .y extension.
- Fix: The memory allocated to the typedef symbol table was not being
  freed after scanning each source file.
- Fix: Failure to reset a variable during error recovery caused
  segmentation faults.

Patchlevel 1

- Fix: Cproto incorrectly generated the parameter "int ..." in
  prototypes of functions taking variable parameters.
- Fix: Function definitions can now be followed by an optional
  semicolon.  I found this feature in every C compiler I tried.

Patchlevel 0

- Added formal parameter promotion.
- Added prototype style that surrounds prototypes with a guard macro.
- Handles C++ style comment //.
- Nifty new way to set prototype output format.
- Got rid of the shell wrapper used to pipe the input through the C
  preprocessor (cpp).
- For the port to MS-DOS, I modified cproto to run without cpp, but
  since I didn't want to reimplement cpp, the program processes only the
  #include and #define directives and ignores all others.  Macro names
  defined by the #define directive are treated like typedef names if
  they appear in declaration specifiers.

Version 1

Patchlevel 3

- Fix: identical typedef names and struct tags should be allowed.
  For example:

	typedef struct egg_salad egg_salad;

	struct egg_salad {
	    int mayo;
	};

	void dine(egg_salad l)
	{
	}

Patchlevel 2

- Fix: A typedef statement should allow a list of typedefs to be declared.
  Example:

	typedef int a, *b;

- Fix: When run with the -v option on this input, cproto did not output
  a declaration for variable "b":

	char *a="one"; char *b="two";

- The options were renamed.  Added new options that change the output
  format of the prototypes.

Patchlevel 1

- Fix: Incorrect prototypes were produced for functions that take
  function pointer parameters or return a function pointer.  For example,
  cproto produced an erroneous prototype for this function definition:

	void
	(*signal (sig, func))()
	int sig;
	void (*func)();
	{
	    /* stuff */
	}

- The lexical analyser now uses LEX.  It should still be compatible with
  FLEX.
