This is a modification of CPROTO 3.7 which was written by Chin Huang.  I added
changes to generate text files in the form of lint libraries (e.g., llib-lc),
and ported to VAX/VMS and HP/Apollo.  I've not been able to get in touch with
him for some time, so I'm posting this as CPROTO 3.9

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cproto is a program that generates function prototypes and variable
declarations from C source code.  It can also convert function definitions
between the old style and the ANSI C style.  This conversion overwrites the
original files, so make a backup copy of your files in case something goes
wrong.

The program isn't confused by complex function definitions as much as other
prototype generators because it uses a yacc generated parser.  By ignoring all
the input between braces, I avoided implementing the entire C language grammar.

Cproto is in the public domain.  If you have any comments or find any bugs,
please let me know.
