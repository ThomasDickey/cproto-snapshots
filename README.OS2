31 January 1998: Cproto 4.6
---------------

The executable in this distribution was built on EMX 0.9b, using the
configure script, gcc 2.7.2, byacc and flex 2.5.2

The ./testing/ directory contains generated MS-DOS .bat scripts.  If you
wish to run those, the source files should be converted to MS-DOS format
using a utility such as 'flip'.
